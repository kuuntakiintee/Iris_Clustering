# Iris Clustering

## Overview
The **Iris Clustering** project implements K-means clustering on the Iris dataset sourced from [Kaggle] https://www.kaggle.com/code/fareselmenshawii/kmeans-iris-clustering/input . The goal is to classify iris flowers into different species based on their physical measurements and visualize the clustering results through various plots.

## Dataset
The project uses the [Iris dataset] https://www.kaggle.com/code/fareselmenshawii/kmeans-iris-clustering/input  , which consists of 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample contains the following features:
- **Sepal Length** (cm)
- **Sepal Width** (cm)
- **Petal Length** (cm)
- **Petal Width** (cm)
- **Species** (target variable): Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica

You can download the dataset directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fareselmenshawii/kmeans-iris-clustering/input)
